# ABOUT ME
I AM FRONTEND DEVELOPER ...  <br> 
I love learning new technologies, program development, and working with a professional team.
I work with the computer for 6 hours almost every day, of which 2 hours are spent on code development, 3 hours are spent on training and updating myself, and the rest are spent surfing the Interne!
